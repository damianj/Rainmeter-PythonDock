# Rainmeter-PythonDock
A dock skin for the Rainmeter  application (Windows) which employs Python to construct itself.

# What this is
- An archive for the code I used in creating this skin. The actual skin for Rainmeter can be downloaded for free from:

 - Instructions on getting everything setup properly can also be found there.

# How to build the executables on Windows
 - Simply run 'python setup.py py2exe' in a command prompt (might have to be elevated depending on your priveleges)
 - Note that you should have Python 3.4+ as your default, and the location of python.exe should be in your environment variables or you'll have to reference it directly.
