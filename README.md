# Rainmeter-PythonDock
A dock skin for the Rainmeter  application (Windows) which employs Python to construct itself.

# Purpose of this Git
I wanted to archive the code I used in creating this skin. The actual skin for rainmeter can be downloaded for free from https://jimenezd.deviantart.com/art/Simple-Dock-2-0-542290583

# How to build the executables on Windows
 - Simply run 'python setup.py py2exe' in a command prompt (might have to be elevated depending on your priveleges)
 - Note that you should have Python 3.4+ as your default, and the location of python.exe should be in your environment variables or you'll have to reference it directly.
